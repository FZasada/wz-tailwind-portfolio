    "freeTimeText": "Outside of work I'm a very active person, and I love spending that time with my dog, whether it's going on long walks or just hanging out at home. I'm also a big Netflix junkie, especially when I find a series that keeps me glued to the screen. It helps me relax while still feeling productive. The same goes for books, especially thrillers or horror stories with plenty of unexpected twists. When the weather is nice, you'll most likely find me outdoors, traveling or exploring new places.",
